# Bank churn data
The dataset contains churn status information for 10,000 customers. It also includes attributes that could influence churn - for example:
- Credit score
- Geographical location (Germany, France, Spain)
- Gender (male, female)
- Age
- Tenure (the number of years the customer was a client at that bank)
- Account balance
- Estimated salary
- Number of products that a customer purchased through the bank
- Credit card status (whether or not a customer has a credit card)
- Active member status (whether or not the customer has an active bank customer status)

The dataset also includes these columns:
- row number
- customer ID
- customer surname
These columns should have no influence on the decision of a customer to leave the bank.

The closure of a customer bank account defines the churn of that customer. The dataset exited column refers to customer's abandonment. Little context about these attributes is available, so you must proceed without background information about the dataset. Our goal is to understand how these attributes contribute to the exited status.
